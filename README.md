# penguins

This repository includes analysis of the public, Palmer Penguins data set, which is a data set containing the results of data collected between 2007 and 2009 by Dr Kristen Gorman during a long term ecological research program. The data set includes morphological measurements of three penguin species, Adelie, Chinstrap and Gentoo. 
This repository holds code to download the Palmer Penguins data set, clean the data and run a statistical test. We fit a linear regression model to analyse penguin flipper length as a function of body mass. We view the results of this linear regression in a linear regression plot separating out each of the three species. The code also includes saving the results and plot of our analysis.
